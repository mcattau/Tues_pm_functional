Initial work done on 21 June, 2016.

This set of analyses expects to have a directory of data sibling but not within it. This is because many of the data files are too large to include in the repository. Some output files may also be external to this directoy although all can be generated by the code here.

The main alalyses are all run via the R amrkdown file called "LiDAR_Classify_Raster.Rmd"
